QuackerBlaster with GTA04 gyro support

This is a forked and slightly modified version of the now defunct http://quackerblaster.tk/

It is a pretty simple point and shoot game where targeting is done by moving the phone around.  Touch the screen anywhere to fire.  This was redone in C++ to reduce dependencies compared to the older pyGame proof of concept.

When the program starts, don't touch the phone while the splash-screen appears, the gyros are calibrating.
